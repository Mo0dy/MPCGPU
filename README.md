### Building and running examples

```
cd examples
make test
./multi.exe
```

### Setting parameters

You can set a bunch of parameters in `include/setting.cuh` file. You can also modify these by passing them as
compiler flags. This will overwrite the default values set for these parameters. Please refer to `Makefile` for
an example.
